e.g.:
2007-11-14: lifev-head and lifev-parallel cross-merging
prerequisite:
------------
latest lifev-parallel to lifev-head merge tagged on lifev-parallel with
LATEST_MERGE_parallel_to_head_2007_XX_XX
and
latest lifev-head to lifev-parallel merge tagged on lifev-head with
LATEST_MERGE_head_to_parallel_2007_XX_XX

cd lifev/
cvs tag PRESENT_MERGE_head_to_parallel_2007_11_14

cd lifev-parallel/
cvs tag PRESENT_MERGE_parallel_to_head_2007_11_14
cd lifev/
cvs -n update -j LATEST_MERGE_parallel_to_head_2007_XX_XX -j PRESENT_MERGE_parallel_to_head_2007_11_14
(remove -n to actually merge)

cd lifev-parallel/
cvs -n update -j LATEST_MERGE_head_to_parallel_2007_XX_XX -j PRESENT_MERGE_head_to_parallel_2007_11_14
(remove -n to actually merge)

Once you are sure about the changes, remove the -n and run the actual update.

Now you have to check your local copies and decide what to commit.
When you are satisfied by the local version, you can commit and tag the
new commited versions with LATEST**


cd lifev/
cvs ci -m"Merging from lifev-parallel"
cvs tag LATEST_MERGE_head_to_parallel_2007_11_14

cd lifev-parallel/
cvs ci -m"Merging from lifev"
cvs tag LATEST_MERGE_parallel_to_head_2007_11_14

note: to see differences btw directories
