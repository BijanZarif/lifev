LifeV was mainly developed with the GCC compiler suite and in particular g++
its C++ compiler.

Unfortunately implementation of certain important classes of LifeV did not
follow the C++ standard and LifeV C++/g++ compliance stops at g+=-3.3. Any
version >= 3.4 won't compile LifeV.

LIFEV MUST BE COMPILED WITH G++ <= 3.3
