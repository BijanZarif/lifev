LifeV developers should use primarily (x)emacs as their development
platform.  This directory holds templates for newly created files in
LifeV with extension support for C++ headers/implementation, m4,
README, automake Makefiles, autotest, and doxygen.

In order to use these templates properly you should install the
template elisp package from Christoph Wedler hosted at
http://emacs-template.sourceforge.net/. It consists in one .el file.
