New in 0.1.0pre5:
=================
* added --enable-debug and --enable-opt to configure script

Bugs fixed in 0.1.0pre4:
========================

  testsuite/test_{} test or moved the test to the lifev-sandbox
* added lifecore/testsuite for small tests programs related to lifecore
* life libraries should be std:: clean. no more using namespace std::
  it is a very bad programming pratice in the long run
* use Quality Management Test tool qmtest for the testsuite
