In the Software/src directory you have all the sources


WHAT TO DO

** To create DoxyGen documentation:

run doxygen in the Root directory (where you have found this file). The doc is in the Doxygen directory. Beware that this directory will NOT be stored in the CVS repository.

** To compile

Go into the Software directory

run

source get_lifeVdir

or

.  get_lifeVdir

This will set the LifeV_dir environment variable.

Look for the place where a recent release of g++ is installed (version 3 is better)

run

source get_g++_install <full-path-of-g++>

or 

get_g++_install <full-path-of-g++>

FOr example

get_g++_install /opt/gcc-3.2/bin/g++

This will set some useful variables for compilation.

Check that the MACHINE environment variable is set to a useful value, such

Linux

run

make clean
make

good luck
